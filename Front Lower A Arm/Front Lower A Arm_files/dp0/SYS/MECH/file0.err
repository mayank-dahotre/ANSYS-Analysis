 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.125   TIME= 20:34:37
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.141   TIME= 20:34:37
 Material number 35 (used by element 31387) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.203   TIME= 20:34:37
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.203   TIME= 20:34:37
 Certain contact elements (for example 31376 & 31136) overlap with       
 other.                                                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.297   TIME= 20:34:37
 Multiple constraints have been applied on degree of freedom 1 of        
 contact node 243.  The program will remove certain internal MPCs.       
 Please check the model carefully.
